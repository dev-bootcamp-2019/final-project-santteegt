# Grading Rubric Checklist

Here you can find comments and references to the source code to help you evaluate the project

## User Interface Requirements

* **Run app on a dev server locally for testing/grading (connecting to Rinkeby if required)**:
* **Should be able to visit a URL and interact with the app (can be localhost)**:
* **The applications should have the following features: 1)Display the current account; 2)Sign transactions using metamask or uPort; 3)Reflect updates to to the contract state**:

## Testing

* **5 tests (Javascript or Solidity or both) with explanations for each smart contract written (where appropriate)**:
* **Tests are properly structured (ie sets up context, executes a call on the function to be tested, and verifies the result is correct)**:
* **Tests provide adequate coverage for the contracts**:
* **All tests pass**:

## Design Pattern Requirements

* **Implement a circuit breaker / emergency stop**:
* **What other design patterns have you used or not used?**:

## Security Tools / Common Attacks

* **Explain what measures theyâ€™ve taken to ensure that their contracts are not susceptible to common attacks"**:

## Library / EthPM

* **At least one of the project contracts includes an import from a library/contract or an ethPM package. If none of the project contracts do, then there is a  demonstration contract that does**:

## Additional Requirements

* **Smart Contract code should be commented according to the specs in the documentation**:
* **Testnet Deployment:  The addresses provided in deployed_addresses.txt correctly point to deployed contracts on the rinkeby testnet. Check by calling a function at the provided address on..**:

## Stretch Goals (for bonus points)

* **Project uses IPFS**:
* **Project uses uPort**:
* **Project uses the Ethereum Name Service**:
* **Project uses an Oracle**:
* **Project implements an Upgradable Pattern Registry or Delegation**:
* **Project includes one smart contract implemented in LLL / Vyper**:
